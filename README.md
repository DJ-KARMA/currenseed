## Description

Currenseed is an online farmer’s market. There is no real world currency here. Products are paid for using “seeds” which can be purchased via credit card, earned by doing certain tasks such as logging in, and by interacting with the website (ie. Buying and making sales). Buyer’s can browse kiosks based on their location, to ensure that they are able to buy fresh produce and other items locally. Buy local, online.

The motivation for this idea was driven by the continued lockdown, the maker movement, and the change in weather. For many people, warmer weather means going to farmer’s markets and buying local fresh produce. As this is no longer an option for the foreseeable future, currenseed will fill this void. We made the decision to use our own currency to rewind to a simpler time of bartering and trading.
